# Introduction

`VueZeyeClient` plugin for [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org) to easily implement RTC using [mediasoup](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup)

Designed to be used with [Zeye-server](https://github.com/stasoft91/zeye-server)

Features include:
- Developer friendly medisaoup-client functions Vue integration (hopefully)
- <[zeyePeerMedia](./zeyePeerMedia)> component
- Okay, basically this is under the hood part of [mediasoip-nuxt-demo](https://github.com/stasoft91/mediasoup-nuxt-demo) with a lot of sugar on it
- Also very WIP
