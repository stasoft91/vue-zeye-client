# Introduction

`VueZeyeClient` plugin is plugin for [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org) to easily implemen RTC using [mediasoup](https://github.com/versatica/mediasoup).

Features include:

- Developer friendly medisaoup-client functions Vue integration (hopefully)
- [zeyePeerMedia](./zeyePeerMedia) component
- Okay, basically this is under the hood part of [mediasoip-nuxt-demo](https://github.com/stasoft91/mediasoup-nuxt-demo) with a lot of sugar on it
- Also very WIP

[Get started](./started) or play with the [demo](https://github.com/vue-zeye-client/tree/dev/demo)
